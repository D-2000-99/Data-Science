## Pneumonia Detection
Pneumonia is an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs. Chest x-rays of an infected patient show
white spots in the lungs (called infiltrates) which identify an infection.

A CNN model is used to classify X-ray images as either normal lungs or pneumonia infected lungs.
The Neural Network was trained on 5232 images and is saved as 'pneumonia_model.h5'.
