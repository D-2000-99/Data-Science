## Exploring CIFAR-10, Transfer Learning and CNN model building  

In this notebook our objective is to explore the famous CIFAR_10 and try to build models to accurately classify images.  
We will be trying out transfer learning techniques, namely VGG16 and ResNet50, and will also be building a customized CNN model.
